# QuickNotes

How I take notes

Unfortunate my laptop struggles when trying to keep up the programs I have open and tabs on my browser. Specifically google drive is the worst offender of this. 

To assit with this is I have made a workflow that limits the number of tabs I have open and substantially reduces the resources needed. 

Although linux has cleaner cut libraries to allow for this, this will be oriented specifically to MacOS. 
Tools needed:
  MacOS
  iterm (terminal simulator) 
  homebrew
